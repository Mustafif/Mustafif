## About 
My name is Mustafif Khan and most of my projects are not in my own account, but in my organization 
account [MKProj](https://github.com/MKProj/). When I first started doing more serious programming, I 
started with C++ but ended up making a better CLI version in Rust using `structopts`. Ever since then 
almost every project has been in Rust, except a few times (When MKProj.com was on Blazor, now in Rocket). 
I'm not an expert in any way, and still feel like a novice, but I do love learning and hope I can excel in 
programming mainly for the fun of it. I love Linux and prefer Linux Distros over Windows any day, and if 
I'm getting myself into more debates then I also feel C > C++, and Rust > Go, but I say this with my use cases 
and cannot say for everyone's or in general.
